\subsection{System Testing}
Once all the modules have been integrated, the system as whole should be tested for requirements satisfaction, both functional and non-functional.

\paragraph{Performance Testing}
Checking if the performance constraints defined in the RASD\textsuperscript{\cite{rasdperf}} are met is an important phase when testing the system as a whole. Moreover, it can help with the optimization of algorithms and queries (if helpful) and the identification of bottlenecks.

\paragraph{Load Testing}
This test should check that the system can handle the load defined in the previous document\textsuperscript{\cite{rasdperf}} and is fundamental to expose potential memory occupancy issues.

\paragraph{Stress Testing}
This final test type should test the ability of the system to handle failures and recover from them. 

\paragraph{Other tests}
After the system testing is successfully completed, an acceptance test can be done in order to assess the usability and the validity of the system. Finally, if the system is going to be used in an environment which is different from the developing one, and installation test can be carried out
