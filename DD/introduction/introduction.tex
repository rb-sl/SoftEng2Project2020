\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}

\subsection{Purpose}
This document represents the DD (Design Document) of the CLup application; it describes CLup's architecture and integrates with the RASD. Furthermore, it describes its components, how they interact, and what is the plan for implementation, integration and testing.

\subsection{Scope}
\subsubsection{Problem description}
CLup is a software-to-be that will help stores and customers preventing dangerous crowds during shopping due to the current Covid-19 Pandemic. This system should offer the possibility to line up from home for stores while still allowing to physically line up for stores. Moreover, it should offer the possibility to book a visit for a chosen store and get notifications about stores occupancy during the week.
The system should also allow store managers to add their stores to the system and monitor entrances.

The application has to be easy-to-use, scalable and reliable.
