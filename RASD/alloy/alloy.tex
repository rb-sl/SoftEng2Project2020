\section{Formal Analysis Using Alloy}
\label{sect:alloy}
This section describes the model defined through the Alloy language\textsuperscript{\cite{alloy}}. It is used to define the subset of the domain used to handle tickets, that represents the most critical portion of the system. 

As it can be noted in Section \ref{sect:run}, the chosen bitwidth is 7, thus allowing the generation of integers between $-64$ and $+63$ to meet all constraints.
