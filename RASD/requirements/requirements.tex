\subsection{External interface requirements}

\input{requirements/ui}

\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
On the e-Customer side, hardware interfaces will be the user's own devices, especially mobile.

For what concerns Store Managers, the system will be interfaced to a device with a camera or to a dedicated QR reader to scan codes, a printer for physical tickets and a screen to display the current number.

\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
CLup will offer two separate user interfaces based on the user's functions (e-Customer or Store Manager), either through mobile or web-based applications. 

The system itself will not offer public interfaces for other applications, but will need to be connected to the web mapping service through its API.

\subsubsection{Communication interfaces}
As security is a major concern, all client-server communication will use HTTPS, based on the security of TLS 1.3. APIs will be accessed through the REST protocol, encrypted using TLS as well.
