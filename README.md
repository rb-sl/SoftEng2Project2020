This repository hosts files related to the CLup (Customers Line-up) project, including the assignment and the final presentation (under the deliverables folder).

The list of tools and software used can be found at the end of each document.

### Feedback and results
The document and sources in this repository reflect those presented for the exam, but during the evaluation some corrections were given:
* Domain [D0] was wrong, as that is an aspect to which the application can react
* Goals [G0] and [G1] were wrong, as those are not functionalities offered by the application (more supporting the main functionalities)
* Requirements always need a subject (The system must...)

These corrections are reported here but are not reflected in the documents.

This project was evaluated with 13/14 points.
